    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

      "\n",
      "President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is addressing the nation, concluding his 5-year term as President of India. He expresses gratitude to everyone who has been a part of his journey, from different walks of life, including politics, science, academia, arts, and more. He shares unique experiences and messages from his time in office, highlighting the importance of accelerating development and fulfilling the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech begins by outlining 10 important messages, including accelerating development, empowering villages, and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. The speaker then delves into each message, starting with \"Accelerate Development: Aspiration of the Youth\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker recalls a question posed by a young girl named Anukriti from Haryana, who asked why India cannot become a developed nation by 2020. The speaker notes that this question has stayed with them ever since, and they intend to address this aspiration of the youth by accelerating development in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker, in response to a question from Anukriti, acknowledged her thought-provoking inquiry about why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. The speaker assured Anukriti that her question would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that efforts would be made to work towards achieving her dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and achieving developed India by 2020. The speaker highlights the aspirations of the youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speech also mentions the speaker's visit to a village in Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council taking decisions and making progress, but notes that physical connectivity is still needed to fully develop the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of developing rural areas, particularly in Nagaland, by providing physical connectivity through quality roads to facilitate the movement of products from villages to markets. They also highlight the potential for transformation if all 600,000 villages in India are empowered to take charge of their development and are well-connected with each other and urban societies. The speaker also mentions an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, called PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas), which aims to provide three types of connectivity (physical, electronic, and knowledge) to 65 villages with a population of 300,000, including healthcare centers and other facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the economic development model of Periyar PURA, a project that has transformed a 200-acre waste land into a cultivable area. The project has created a range of employment opportunities, trained entrepreneurs, and established self-help groups. The villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, food processing, and marketing, which has led to sustainable economic development in the region. Additionally, the project has partnered with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women to develop products using local raw materials and core competencies available in Thanjavur district, with a focus on technological support and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a cooperative venture in Thanjavur district, where 65 villages developed internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the help of JETRO specialists and feedback from exhibitions. This project enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products. The speaker believes that similar PURA (Private Urban and Regional Development Agency) projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated 7000 such projects required nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares their experience meeting over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers were interested in the gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker also mentioned their previous address to agricultural scientists at a symposium, where they summarized practical suggestions from farmers. The speaker emphasized the need to double agricultural production with limited resources and improve the economy through the \"Seed to Food\" principle, as agriculture is the backbone of the nation. The goal is to empower farmers to protect and nurture the land for a second green revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech seems to be a motivational message to farmers, encouraging them to work together with scientists and industries to increase agricultural growth by at least 4% per annum. The speaker mentions that they have gained confidence in the nation's ability to achieve this goal through the partnership of these groups for value addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a personal experience with a person who is physically challenged, but has a remarkable talent for music. The person, with a positive attitude and perseverance, has been encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion. He has even performed in front of a large audience at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in July 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also references the impact of a disaster and how the people and children affected by it have come together to overcome the challenges they face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker describes their experience visiting Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir in 2005, shortly after a devastating earthquake. They found that the school building was severely damaged and met with the villagers, who expressed their gratitude for the rescue and relief efforts by the Army, Air Force, and state government. The speaker was impressed by the courage and resilience of the villagers, who despite facing severe losses, had adapted to their new circumstances and were determined to overcome their problems, rather than letting them overcome them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker described a visit to a village affected by an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces. The speaker mentioned that the villagers were smiling and interacting with them, and that the school was functioning in temporary tents. They also witnessed the Chief Justice and government authorities settling relief grants for victims whose homes were damaged. The speaker highlighted the courage they saw in the villagers, and mentioned a similar experience they had in 2005 when visiting Car Nicobar Islands, where they saw the unique trait of resilience among the islanders despite facing many challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a moving experience on Car-Nicobar island after the 2004 Tsunami. Despite the devastating loss of life, the islanders' unique trait was that they took in the affected victims as their own children, essentially creating a community without orphanages. The speaker was inspired by their courage and wrote a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which they sang together with the villagers. The poem expresses the islanders' resilience and faith in overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker addressed the Pan African Parliament on September 16, 2004, proposing the concept of the Pan African e-Network, a satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. The pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where Indian and African universities are offering an MBA course to Ethiopian students and providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the achievements of the Indian government in using technology to benefit people, particularly in Africa. The speaker mentions that Hyderabad has been providing live tele-consultation services to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital since 2006. The speaker is proud to say that India is leading the way in bringing technological advancements to Africa, enabling societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the bravery and dedication of India's military personnel, specifically mentioning the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force. The speaker recounts their own experiences of visiting the Siachen Glacier, going on an underwater journey in a submarine, and flying a fighter jet, and expresses pride in the soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who perform their duties with distinction, even in challenging circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of national defense and security forces, highlighting their duty to protect the nation in all circumstances. The speaker reflects on their experiences presenting colors, attending passing out parades, and interacting with troops and family members of the Defense Forces, praising their bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty. The speech also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in maintaining safety and security for citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker met a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming young people into enlightened citizens. The Lead India 2020 Foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, with visible positive results in the Medak district. The students have shown self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a reduced fear of public speaking. The speaker also shared the story of Ms. Padma, a student leader from a tribal school, who was inspired by the 10-point oath and was able to influence her father to stop smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is impressed by a young girl who helped her father quit smoking after attending a training camp. This inspires the speaker, who believes that the 540 million youth in India (ages 25 and under) are the country's most powerful resource. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering these youth through value-based education and leadership to unlock their potential. The speech concludes by highlighting the diversity and unity of India's culture, and the speaker expresses gratitude for the opportunity to experience this richness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich and diverse cultural and civilizational treasures, even as the country pursues economic growth. They believe it is the duty of present generations to preserve these treasures for future generations. To achieve this, the speaker advocates for a nationwide effort involving multiple institutions and the participation of all sectors of society. The speaker also expresses confidence in India's potential to become a developed nation by 2020, stating that the country's natural resources, progress, and 540 million young people are all assets that can contribute to this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is expressing happiness about the progress being made towards empowering society. They quote a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", emphasizing that anything one desires can be achieved if they aim high. The speaker calls upon citizens to work together to achieve the missions of a developed India 2020. The four key goals mentioned are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Providing equitable access to energy and clean water\n",
      "3. Ensuring harmony between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Ensuring education with a value system is available to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic background.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a ideal nation, which includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A society that is fair and just, where everyone has equal opportunities regardless of their background.\n",
      "* A nation that attracts the best and brightest individuals from around the world.\n",
      "* Universal access to high-quality healthcare.\n",
      "* Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance.\n",
      "* A society where poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated.\n",
      "* A nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustainable growth.\n",

He proudly declares that India is one of the best places to live and is proud of its leadership.
